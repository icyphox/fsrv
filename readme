HOOKS

Hooks can be defined in the 'hooks/' directory for specific filetypes.
These can be written in any language, provided the file is executable,
and accepts one argument: the file to execute against.

For example: the hooks/7z.sh file will run against all 7z files, and will
recieve the filename as an argument ($1). The filetype is determined by
parsing magic bytes, and not by file extension.
